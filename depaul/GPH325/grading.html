For questions requiring the submission of a POV Ray file, submit the .pov file and all .inc files necessary to render the image. All submitted files must be named according to the following scheme:<br>						<br>						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first initial + your last name + '_' + hw#q#<br>						<br>						For example, if John Lasseter was submitting a text file as an answer to homework 4, question 3, his file prefix would be <strong>jlasseter_hw4q3</strong>.txt. If Edward Catmull was submitting a POVRay file as an answer to homework 2, question 2, his file prefix would be <strong>ecatmull_hw2q2</strong>.pov.<br>						<br>						Submitted POVRay files must also contain a header with the following documentation:<br>					</p>					<ul class="basic">						<li>Your name</li>						<li>The name of the file</li>						<li>The assignment and question numbers</li>						<li>A description of what the file does (brevity is key here)</li>					</ul>					<br>					<p class="basic">Multiple files can be zipped together and submitted through dlweb. If you submit a zip file, name your file using your first initial, your last name, and the assignment number. For example, if John Lasseter was submitting assignment 2, his zip file would be named <strong>jlasseter_assignment2.zip</strong>.<br>					<br>					The following gaffes will result in automatic point deductions:					</p>					<ul class="basic">						<li>A zip file that is unreadable or cannot be opened: 10 points first infraction, 25 points on each subsequent infraction. (Unzip your file and test it before uploading it.)</li>						<li>A naming scheme that does match the one outlined above: 5 pts. per file</li>						<li>Failure to include documentation: 5 pts. per problem</li>						<li>Failure to submit a zip file before class begins: 50 pts.</li>					</ul>					<br>					<p class="basic">					Note that it is possible to answer all the question in an assignment correctly and still fail the assignment.					</p>					<br>				</td>			</tr>		</table>		<br>		<br>	</body></html>
