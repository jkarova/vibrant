Experiment with different values for the arguments of each texture that you use, also try transforming the texture using translation, rotation and scaling in the texture declaration. One of your images must feature bump mapping, all of your images should possess some noise (warp). Try to create interesting images by experimenting. You are being given creative license here - use it.<br>							<br>							If you have question about how to apply the textures, try looking for answers in POV-Ray's help file before emailing me and make sure you read chapters 6 & 7. Also, see if you can figure out how to include the teapot by reading through the include file.<br>							<br>						</li>						<li>(50 pts.) Write a proposal for the final project. For the final project, you will be creating an image using the tools we've learned, and will learn, in POV-Ray. While we still have more to learn, it's imperative to begin deciding a focus for the final project. Choose a subject and theme and decide how you are going to execute them.  Consider what freedoms, and limitations, you will face using POV-Ray to accomplish your goal. Your image will be graded on your technical execution as well as your artistic vision - and your ability to convey a theme.<br>						<br>						If you are having difficulty deciding on a subject, try writing down a few of your favorite books, movies, or historical periods. If you have time, visit the Art Institute or the MCA this weekend. Entrance fees are reduced for students at both museums, and they are both full of creative ideas.						</li>					</ol>					<br>					<br>					<p class="basic"><a href="assignments.html" class="innerpage">back to the Assignment page</a></p>				</td>			</tr>		</table>		<br>		<br>	</body></html>
