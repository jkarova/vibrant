Lectures will be comprised of fundamental topics exposing students to the numerous considerations of design and art, software used in the class will be presented, and some class time will be spent working on projects demonstrating pertenant topics. Projects will involve using the principles and software discussed in class to produce artwork.<br>			<br>			This course serves as a foundation to the non-verbal, visual communication so essential to the digital interfaces that are to become a major product environment of the student of Human Computer Interaction and the student of Computer Graphics and Animation. More than providing a creative, synthetic basis for on-screen environments, this course also provides an evaluative, analytic basis for these environments.<br>			<br>			A central strategy of this course is to compare, contrast and experience the application of perceptual principles in both physical and digital media. The governing principle here proffers that parallel experiences in these two categories can generate a synergy benefiting both modes of creation, especially the digital. Working with physical objects is especially important, because visualizing 3-D space on a 2-D monitor screen is a very far cry from understanding 3-D environments.<br>			<br>			With the advent of 3-D printing technology solid object models are being directly created from digital models. One result is that the terms solid object interface and solid view are often used as synonyms for physical objects derived from digital models.<br>		</p>		<h2>Texts</h2>		<p class="basic">			<ul class="basic">				<li><em>Principles of Three-Dimensional Design</em>, Stephen Luecking</li>				<li><em>3-D Digital Workshop</em>, Stephen Luecking (<a href="tutorial_errata.html">text errata here</a>)</li>			</ul>		</p>		<h2>Supplies</h2>		<p class="basic">			Software needed for the class is available in all GPH labs.			<ul class="basic">				<li>Sketch Book</li>				<li>X-acto Knife</li>				<li>Elmer's Glue</li>				<li>Cork-backed Ruler</li>				<li>Adobe Illustrator</li>				<li>Rhino 3D</li>			</ul>		</p>		<h2>Labs</h2>		<p class="basic">			The Solid Objects Graphics Lab (SOGL, 802) is available for student use, lab assistants are there to assist students, and materials needed for the projects in the class can be found there. The Animation Lab (722) has computers loaded with the software needed for class. Labs are staffed during the hours below, but access should be available via swipe card during school hours.<br>			<br>			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>SOGL Lab Staff Hours</strong><br>			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mon  12:00pm-5:00pm<br>			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wed  12:00pm-10:00pm<br>			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat  12:00pm-6:00pm<br>			<br>			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Animation Lab Staff Hours</strong><br>			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mon  5:00pm-10:00pm<br>			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tue  12:00pm-5:30pm<br>			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wed  5:00pm-10:00pm<br>			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri  12:00pm-6:00pm<br>			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat  12:00pm-6:00pm<br>		</p>		<h2>Projects</h2>		<p class="basic">Three projects will be due during the course of this class:<br/></p>			<ul class="basic">				<li>&nbsp;Project One: <em>Architectural Plane</em>, a construction of planes using foam core board with an applied textured surface<br>				<br>				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project asks that the student compose with 2-D shapes thrust into a 3-D space. It will exploit the planar relationships of interpenetration, abutting and folding and the planar functions of dividing and activating space. The grid will be incorporated as a organizational device, and texture may be applied to the planes at the discretion of the student. Students will work towards the final product through a series of sketches and mock-ups.<br>				<br>				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Materials: Sketch Book, Illustrator, foam core board, X-acto Knife, glue<br>				<br>				</li>				<li>&nbsp;Project Two: <em>Surface Relief</em> and <em>Cross Surface</em>, A relief of a modeled NURBS surface<br>				<br>				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First using Rhino to model a NURBS surface, the student will then utilize cross sections of paper to bring the modeled surface into relief.<br>				<br>				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Materials: Rhino, Illustrator, 140 lb paper, X-acto, glue<br>				<br>				</li>				<li>&nbsp;Project Three: <em>Geometric Object and Sculpture</em><br>				<br>				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students will choose an object they come into contact with daily and model that object in Rhino as a series of primitive geometric shapes. Students will then interpret the modeled object into polygonal surfaces on paper, foldable ans re-constructed from paper patterns.<br>				<br>				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Materials: Rhino, Illustrator, 140 lb paper, foam core board, X-acto, glue				<br>				</li>				<br>				<li>&nbsp;Optional Paper: <em>A Chicago Sculpture or Building</em><br>				<br>				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose a sculpture or building in Chicago and, using the vocabulary we have formalized in class, describe that subject: it's form in space. The paper should be 3-4 pages. If you receive a satisfactory grade on the paper, you may exchange this grade for one of your projects.<br>				<br>				</li>			</ul>			<br/>		<h2>Requirements</h2>		<p class="basic">			Complete all three projects and meet attendance requirements.<br>			<br>			Assessment of the projects will take the following aspects into account:<br>		</p>		<ul class="basic">			<li>&nbsp;<strong>Craft</strong>: the quality of execution</li>			<li>&nbsp;<strong>Invention</strong>: the creative application of learned principles</li>			<li>&nbsp;<strong>Understanding</strong>: the effective application of learned principles</li>			<li>&nbsp;<strong>Adherence</strong>: the degree to which problems meet the assignment guidelines</li>			<li>&nbsp;<strong>Integration</strong>: how all elements work together to project a theme, the gestalt</li>		</ul>		<p class="basic">		<br>			Your grade will be a composite of your success in meeting these five objectives.<br>			<br>			All assignments will have a deadline in order to participate in schedule critiques. Late works will be discounted by one letter grade for every week late (the first week late begins after the class that the assignment is due) ­ no exceptions. You will also be discounted one letter grade if you do not attend the assignment critique. The instructor reserves the right to reject excessively sloppy work.<br>		</p>		<h2>Grade Scale</h2>		<p class="basic">		Projects will comprise 75% of the final grade, participation 15%, and a paper 10%.<br>		<br>		Grades of A+ are reserved for extraordinary work.<br>		<br>		<table border="0" class="tablebasic">			<tr align="left"><td>95 - 100</td><td>=</td><td>A</td></tr>			<tr align="left"><td>90 - 94</td><td>=</td><td>A-</td></tr>			<tr align="left"><td>87 - 89</td><td>=</td><td>B+</td></tr>			<tr align="left"><td>84 - 86</td><td>=</td><td>B</td></tr>			<tr align="left"><td>80 - 83</td><td>=</td><td>B-</td></tr>			<tr align="left"><td>77 - 79</td><td>=</td><td>C+</td></tr>			<tr align="left"><td>74 - 76</td><td>=</td><td>C</td></tr>			<tr align="left"><td>70 - 73</td><td>=</td><td>C-</td></tr>			<tr align="left"><td>67 - 69</td><td>=</td><td>D+</td></tr>			<tr align="left"><td>64 - 66</td><td>=</td><td>D</td></tr>			<tr align="left"><td>60 - 63</td><td>=</td><td>D-</td></tr>			<tr align="left"><td>0 - 59</td><td>=</td><td>F</td></tr>		</table>		</p>		<h2>Schedule</h2>		<table border="2" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" align="left" bordercolordark="#57617E" bordercolorlight="#57617E" bordercolor="#57617E" title="GPH212 Class Schedule" class="tablebasic">			<tr align="left" valign="top"  bordercolordark="#57617E" bordercolorlight="#57617E">				<td width="30" align="left">Week</td>				<td width="55" align="left">Date</td>				<td width="150" align="left">Class Content</td>				<td width="50" align="left">Demo</td>				<td width="300" align="left">Reading</td>				<td width="250" align="left">Assignments</td>				<td width="90" align="left">Critique</td>			</tr>			<tr align="left" valign="top">				<td>1</td>				<td>March 29</td>				<td width="172">					Class Introduction<br>					Lecture: <a href="01_Problem_Solving.html">Problem Solving</a><br>					Lecture: <a href="02_Form_in_Space.html">Form in Space</a><br>					Lecture: <a href="03_Plane_and_Space.html">Plane &amp;
